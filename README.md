## Features

- **Autonomous Multi-Step Analysis Pipeline** — Automatically cleans, explores, and analyzes datasets without manual intervention
- **Auto-Generated Visualizations & Charts** — Produces publication-ready charts and graphs tailored to your data
- **Natural Language Insight Reports** — Generates clear, written summaries explaining findings and patterns
- **Smart Feature Detection** — Automatically identifies key variables, correlations, and anomalies

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Python | Core language for the analysis engine |
| scikit-learn | Machine learning models and statistical analysis |
| Pandas | Data manipulation and transformation |
| Matplotlib | Data visualization and chart generation |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andrewpaik/data-analyst-agent.git
cd data-analyst-agent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the agent on a dataset
python agent.py --input data/sample.csv
```

## How It Works

1. **Input your data** — Provide a CSV, Excel, or database connection
2. **Automated exploration** — The agent profiles the data, detects types, and identifies quality issues
3. **Analysis pipeline** — Statistical tests, correlation analysis, and ML models run automatically
4. **Report generation** — Receive a complete report with visualizations, insights, and recommendations

## Example Output

```
📊 Analysis Complete
├── Data Quality: 98.5% (2 missing values handled)
├── Key Correlations: revenue ↔ marketing_spend (r=0.87)
├── Anomalies Detected: 3 outliers in Q3 sales
├── Visualizations: 8 charts generated
└── Report: analysis_report.pdf
```

## Built With AI

This project was built using AI-assisted development with **Claude** and **Cursor**, demonstrating the power of modern AI tools for rapid application development.
