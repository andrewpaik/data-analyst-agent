# Defense Technology Industry — Financial Analysis Report

**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Data Source:** Yahoo Finance (yfinance API) — live market data
**Coverage:** 10 defense contractors, FY2021–2025, 5 years of monthly stock prices

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **The defense sector is in a historic bull run.** All 10 companies posted positive 1-year returns. The median return of +48.2% dramatically outperformed the broader market, fueled by NATO spending commitments, the Ukraine conflict, and Indo-Pacific security concerns.
- **$1.22 trillion in combined market cap** across 10 companies — with Palantir ($310B) now larger than Lockheed Martin ($142B) by market cap despite having 1/24th the revenue, reflecting a market that is repricing defense-tech at software multiples.
- **RTX and General Dynamics offer the best risk-adjusted returns** — highest return-to-volatility ratios at reasonable valuations (P/E 23-40x, EV/EBITDA 16-20x).
- **Boeing remains the margin turnaround story** — $89.5B in revenue (largest in the sector) but negative operating margin (-6.0%) and negative FCF. Its trailing P/E of 96x prices in a recovery that hasn't fully materialized.
- **The sector's median beta of 0.41 makes defense a rare combination** of strong returns with low market correlation — effectively an uncorrelated alpha generator over the past 5 years.

## 3. Findings

### Finding 1: Palantir Has Rewritten the Defense Valuation Playbook

- **What:** Palantir trades at 206x P/E and 227x EV/EBITDA — over 10x the sector median — yet has a market cap ($310B) exceeding Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics combined by market cap ranking position. Its 80.2% gross margin is 4-8x that of traditional primes.
- **So What:** The market is assigning software-like valuations to Palantir's AI/analytics platform, fundamentally separating "defense technology" from "defense manufacturing." This creates a two-tier valuation framework within the sector that didn't exist 3 years ago. Palantir's 5yr return of +459% dwarfs even the best traditional contractor (RTX at +184%).
- **Now What:** Investors should view PLTR as a tech company with defense exposure, not a defense company. Its valuation assumes sustained 20%+ revenue growth — any deceleration would cause disproportionate multiple compression. Traditional defense investors seeking growth exposure should consider the risk/reward of PLTR vs. higher-growth traditional names like L3Harris (+70% 1yr).

### Finding 2: The Sector Offers Rare "High Return + Low Volatility"

- **What:** The median monthly volatility is just 6.8% with a median 1yr return of +48%. General Dynamics has the lowest volatility (4.7%/month) and still returned +43% in a year. The sector median beta of 0.41 means defense stocks move less than half as much as the market.
- **So What:** This is highly unusual — normally high returns come with high risk. Defense spending is non-cyclical (government-funded, multi-year contracts), creating a structural floor under revenues. The geopolitical environment (NATO 2% GDP commitments, AUKUS, Taiwan Strait tensions) has added a secular growth tailwind on top of this defensive foundation.
- **Now What:** For portfolio construction, defense offers genuine diversification — low beta, strong absolute returns, and minimal correlation to consumer/tech cycles. RTX (return/risk ratio: 0.306) and GD (0.305) are the optimal risk-adjusted choices.

### Finding 3: Boeing Is the Sector's Biggest Outlier — In Every Direction

- **What:** Boeing generates the most revenue ($89.5B) but has the worst operating margin (-6.0%), worst FCF margin (-2.1%), and worst return/risk ratio (0.039). Its debt-to-equity ratio of 1,033% is catastrophic compared to the sector average of ~60%.
- **So What:** Boeing's defense business is being dragged down by its commercial aviation problems. Despite massive revenue, the company destroyed cash in its latest fiscal year. Its P/E of 96x prices in a full recovery, but margin improvement has been glacial. The 5yr return of -6.3% makes it the only negative performer in the entire sector.
- **Now What:** Boeing is a high-conviction turnaround bet, not a defense sector play. Investors should size positions based on recovery timeline expectations. If Boeing can achieve even the sector-median operating margin of 10%, it would generate ~$9B in operating income vs. its current -$5.4B — a $14B swing.

### Finding 4: Revenue Growth Is Accelerating Across the Sector

- **What:** Revenue CAGRs range from +4.7% (Northrop) to +22.9% (Palantir). The traditional primes are growing at 5-10% annually — well above the historical defense spending growth rate of 3-4%. Boeing's revenue is volatile (+34.5% in FY2025 after -14.5% in FY2024) due to delivery fluctuations.
- **So What:** The sector is in an unusual position where both organic growth AND multiple expansion are occurring simultaneously. This is typically a late-cycle phenomenon in other sectors, but defense spending has structural multi-year tailwinds (European rearmament, US bipartisan defense support, AI/cyber investments).
- **Now What:** Monitor the FY2026 defense budget and NATO spending trajectories. If European defense spending hits the 2.5-3% GDP targets being discussed, the revenue growth acceleration could sustain for another 3-5 years, supporting current valuations.

### Finding 5: Margins Tell the Real Story — Not Revenue

- **What:** There is no statistically significant correlation between operating margins and 1yr stock returns (r = -0.260, p = 0.47). However, the P/E ratio strongly correlates with returns (r = 0.870, p = 0.001). The highest-returning stocks (KTOS +228%, HII +113%) had low margins but were re-rated on growth expectations.
- **So What:** The market is rewarding narrative and growth trajectory over current profitability. This is a sentiment-driven market where expectations matter more than fundamentals. Kratos (1.4% net margin) returned 228% because investors are buying its drone/autonomous systems pipeline, not its current earnings.
- **Now What:** Be cautious about overpaying for growth narratives. History shows P/E-driven rallies can reverse sharply. The statistically significant P/E-to-return correlation (r = 0.87) suggests momentum/growth chasing, which can unwind if geopolitical tensions ease or budgets tighten.

### Finding 6: Northrop Grumman Is the Quiet Overperformer

- **What:** NOC has the highest net margin in the sector (10.0%), a strong EBITDA margin (17.2%), reasonable P/E (23.9x), the lowest beta in the group (0.04), and a solid 1yr return (+53.1%). Its revenue CAGR of 4.7% is the lowest among primes, but its margins more than compensate.
- **So What:** NOC is the only company that scores well across every dimension — profitability, valuation, returns, and risk. Its focus on high-margin programs (B-21 bomber, nuclear deterrent, space systems) gives it pricing power that pure-play defense manufacturers lack.
- **Now What:** NOC is the benchmark for "quality defense exposure." Its near-zero beta and high margins make it suitable as a core defense holding. The risk is that its lower growth rate may cap future re-rating potential compared to faster-growing peers.

## 4. Recommendations

| Priority | Insight | Actionable Takeaway |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **CORE** | RTX + GD = best risk-adjusted defense exposure | Best return/volatility ratios at fair valuations (P/E 23-40x) |
| **CORE** | NOC = quality defensive anchor | Highest margins (10% net), lowest beta (0.04), reasonable P/E (24x) |
| **GROWTH** | PLTR + KTOS = high-growth / high-risk bets | 200x+ P/E demands sustained 20%+ revenue growth — size positions accordingly |
| **TURNAROUND** | BA = binary outcome bet | Massive upside if margins normalize; massive downside if recovery stalls |
| **VALUE** | LDOS at 17.5x P/E is cheapest in sector | Solid 7.5% net margin, 6.6% CAGR, lowest P/E — potential re-rating candidate |
| **MONITOR** | Watch European defense budgets for sector catalyst | NATO 2.5-3% GDP targets could sustain multi-year revenue acceleration |

## 5. Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Financial data:** Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) — income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements (FY2021–2025)
- **Market data:** Monthly stock prices (5-year history, March 2021 – February 2026)
- **Company profiles:** Real-time market cap, valuation multiples, risk metrics

### Companies Analyzed
| Tier | Companies | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Prime contractors** | LMT, RTX, BA, GD, NOC | Top 5 by DoD contract value |
| **Large specialists** | LHX, LDOS, HII | Major defense-focused companies |
| **Defense tech / growth** | PLTR, KTOS | Technology-forward defense companies |

### Statistical Methods
- Pearson correlations for cross-sectional relationships (10 companies)
- Revenue CAGR calculations for growth comparison
- Monthly return volatility (standard deviation) for risk measurement
- Return/risk ratios (mean monthly return / volatility) for risk-adjusted comparison
- Note: Small sample size (n=10) limits statistical power — correlations should be interpreted directionally

### Assumptions & Caveats
- Financial data represents reported fiscal years, which may not align across companies (some report calendar year, some offset)
- Boeing's commercial aviation segment is included in consolidated financials, making pure defense comparison imperfect
- Palantir's government vs. commercial revenue split is not separated in this analysis
- Stock returns are total price returns; dividends are not included (would modestly favor LMT, NOC, GD which pay 1.5-2.5% yields)
- Market data as of February 2026 — valuations and returns are point-in-time
